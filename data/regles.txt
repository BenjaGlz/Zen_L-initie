                                        /
Duration of a game: 15 to 30 minutes. /
                                        /
Contents: 1 board of 121 squares, 12 black pawns, 12 white pawns, 1 pawn called "Zen". /
                                        /
Aim of the game: the winner is the first player who manages to form a continuous chain with all /
of his pawns still on the board, including "Zen", if it is still in play. /
                                        /
The pawns are arranged on the board in a prescribed pattern. /
Flow of the game: each player in turn moves a pawn of his color or "Zen" according to 4 very simple rules. /
                                        /
Rule #1: pawns move in a straight line in any direction. /
A pawn must always move as many squares as there are pawns on the chosen line of movement /
(horizontal or vertical or diagonal). All pawns are taken into account, including the moved pawn. /
                                        /
Rule #2: Any pawn may pass over one or more pawns of its own color, but never over those of its opponent. /
                                        /
Rule #3: any pawn may capture an opposing pawn by placing itself on the square occupied by the captured pawn in accordance with rule #1./
The captured pawn is then removed from the game for good. /
                                        /
Rule #4 : at each move, the "Zen" pawn common to all players can be either white or black depending on the interest of the one who plays. /
It moves like the other pieces, but can also be taken. /
                                        /
Pawn rule : The Zen pawn cannot be moved if none of the squares around it are occupied. /
                                        /
